# Executive-Self-Service-BI-AI
### AI-Powered Portfolio Analytics Platform (Streamlit + DuckDB + LLM SQL Engine)

---

## Overview

Executive AI Self-Service BI is an experimental analytics platform designed to simulate a **next-generation Asset Management Intelligence System**.

The project combines:

- Executive-level dashboards
- AI-generated SQL queries
- Self-service analytics
- Real-time visualisation

Unlike traditional BI tools, this application allows users to **ask business questions in natural language** and instantly receive:

- SQL queries generated by AI
- Data results
- Auto-generated visualisations

The goal is to demonstrate how modern ManCo / Asset Management platforms could evolve beyond static dashboards.

---

## Key Value Proposition

This project explores a future where:

- Executives no longer depend on analysts to build reports
- Data exploration becomes conversational
- Dashboards adapt dynamically to business questions

### What makes this different from Power BI or Tableau?

Traditional BI:
- Static visuals
- Predefined KPIs
- Limited self-service

Executive AI BI:
- Dynamic SQL generation
- Context-aware data exploration
- AI-driven insights layer

It behaves more like a hybrid between:

- Bloomberg Terminal
- Palantir Foundry
- AI Data Copilot

## Data Model

The project uses synthetic but realistic ManCo-style datasets:

### Funds
- NAV
- AUM
- Performance
- Inflows / Outflows
- Net Flow

### Operations
- Transactions
- Fees
- Status (Completed / Failed / Pending)

### HR
- Departments
- Headcount
- Monthly Costs

### Finance
- Revenue
- Costs
- Budget

Data is loaded into DuckDB using a local ingestion script.

👉 Database setup script: :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## Analytics Engine (DuckDB)

DuckDB is used as the analytical layer because it provides:

- SQL performance comparable to columnar warehouses
- Zero-config local execution
- Perfect integration with Python & Streamlit

A unified analytics view is created:

vw_fund_analytics


This view merges:

- fund_metrics
- funds metadata

allowing fast executive queries.

---

## AI SQL Engine

The AI layer translates natural language into DuckDB SQL.

Core responsibilities:

- Understand business questions
- Generate valid SQL queries
- Avoid hallucinated fields
- Respect schema constraints

Engine implementation:
👉 :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### System Behaviour

The AI is instructed to:

- Return SQL only
- Avoid markdown formatting
- Prefer analytics views
- Aggregate intelligently

Example:

User:
"Top funds by inflow last quarter"

AI Output:
SELECT fund_name, SUM(inflow_amount) ...


---

## Executive Dashboard

Main UI file:
👉 :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Features:

- Power BI-style dark theme
- KPI panels with deltas
- Executive filters (slicers)
- AUM & Flow trend analysis
- HR and Finance monitoring
- Premium strategy footprint map

### Visual Philosophy

The design simulates:

- ManCo Blackfin dashboards
- Institutional asset management UIs
- Bloomberg-style executive layouts

---

## AI Self-Service Layer

Users can ask business questions such as:

"Monthly fee trend by strategy"
"Which department has the highest HR cost?"
"Top funds by net flow this year"


The app will:

1. Generate SQL via AI
2. Execute against DuckDB
3. Render an executive-style visual automatically

---

## How It Works (Technical Flow)

1. User writes a question
2. `generate_sql()` sends context + schema to LLM
3. SQL is returned and cleaned
4. DuckDB executes query
5. App auto-detects chart type

No manual dashboard design required.

---

## Installation

### 1. Install dependencies

pip install streamlit duckdb pandas plotly python-dotenv openai


---

### 2. Setup environment

Create a `.env` file:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here


---

### 3. Load database

Run:

python load_duckdb.py


---

### 4. Launch app

streamlit run app.py


---

## Testing DuckDB

Example test script:
👉 :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Why This Project Matters

Asset Management dashboards today are still:

- Static
- Analyst-dependent
- Hard to explore dynamically

This project demonstrates:

- AI-first BI architecture
- Conversational analytics
- Executive-grade UX without enterprise software

It represents a proof-of-concept for:

- AI Copilot BI systems
- Self-service executive intelligence
- Next-generation ManCo analytics platforms

---

## Future Ideas

- AI insight generation
- Anomaly detection layer
- Portfolio risk modelling
- Real market data integration
- Role-based executive views
